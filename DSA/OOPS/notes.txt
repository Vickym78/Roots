OOPS IS A Approach which is diffrent from procedual Approach.

this is done by user_defined data type
eg: - for a class datset we need name , age ,roll 
we want to store it in once ,so we used user defined dataset.


# Next thing is Access modifier 
1) Public :- Anyone can access it 
2) Private:- Only some allowed class can access this
3)Protected: -


Class : - It's a user defined data type and it's a blueprint of object
