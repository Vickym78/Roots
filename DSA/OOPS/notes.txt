OOPS IS A Approach which is diffrent from procedual Approach.

this is done by user_defined data type
eg: - for a class datset we need name , age ,roll 
we want to store it in once ,so we used user defined dataset.


# Next thing is Access modifier 
1) Public :- Anyone can access it 
2) Private:- Only some allowed class can access this
3)Protected: -


Class : - It's a user defined data type and it's a blueprint of object eg: - Animal class

 
Object : - it's an real world entity like me and you , pencil , pen, dog etc...

class not exist in real world , but object exists
Student is class but rohan is object

class have't any size; 
but empty class have size 1
